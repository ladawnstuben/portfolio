            <p>As I progress in my journey as a software developer, I’ve had the privilege of working on diverse
                projects that span different technologies. From front-end web development to back-end systems and
                desktop applications, each project has taught me valuable lessons in problem-solving and design.</p>

            <p>One of the highlights of my development experience is being able to build applications that are both
                efficient and user-friendly. I enjoy the challenge of making technology accessible and valuable to end
                users, ensuring that each solution serves a practical purpose.</p>

            <p>My technical toolkit includes programming languages such as C# and C++, as well as web technologies like
                HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also have experience working with databases, managing data, and writing SQL
                queries. I’m constantly improving my skills and learning new technologies to stay current in this
                rapidly changing field.</p>

                        title="Household Tasks App">
                    <p><strong>Household Tasks App:</strong> This application was created to help users manage daily
                        household chores more efficiently. It offers an intuitive interface where users can add, view,
                        and mark tasks as complete. The app is designed to simplify the organization of household
                        responsibilities.</p>

                    <p>Developed in C++ using the wxWidgets GUI framework, this project showcases my ability to create
                        functional user interfaces while ensuring that data persistence is handled effectively. Users
                        can rely on the app to store their tasks and track their progress over time.</p>

                    <p>Overall, the Household Tasks App is an example of my proficiency in GUI development,
                        object-oriented programming, and data management. It combines utility and simplicity to improve
                        the daily lives of its users.</p>

                    <p><strong>Secret Santa Engine:</strong> This project was developed to streamline the process of
                        organizing a Secret Santa event. It allows users to add participants and automatically assigns
                        Secret Santas, ensuring a smooth and fair distribution.</p>

                    <p>The program also includes features for managing participant lists and keeping track of gift
                        exchanges. It was built using C++, which allowed me to implement key data structures and
                        algorithms that ensure the app runs efficiently and scales easily.</p>

                    <p>This project highlights my skills in problem-solving, algorithm design, and data management. It
                        also showcases my attention to detail and ability to build tools that solve real-world
                        logistical challenges.</p>
