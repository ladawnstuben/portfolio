        <div class="introduction">
            <p>Hello! I'm LaDawn Stuben, an IT Systems Analyst and an aspiring software developer. I’m currently working
                toward a degree in Computer Science and have a passion for creating meaningful software solutions that
                address real-world challenges.</p>

            <p>With a strong background in IT and a keen interest in software engineering, I focus on building
                efficient, scalable systems. My aim is to bring innovation to the table by combining my technical
                knowledge with creativity to solve problems.</p>

            <p>On this portfolio website, you'll find the projects I’ve developed, the skills I’ve gained, and insights
                into the technology industry. If you have any questions or would like to discuss a project, feel free to
                connect through the contact page. I’m always open to collaborating with others.</p>
        </div>

<section class="faq-section">
    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
    <p>
       This FAQ section covers common questions about my projects, development approach, 
       technologies I use, and how to collaborate or learn more. Whether you're curious about 
       the programming languages I favor, wondering how to contribute to an open-source project 
       I've started, or need advice on getting started with a similar career path, these FAQs 
       aim to guide you. 
       
       I’ve compiled some questions below to address various aspects, from technical details 
       about my code to best practices for beginning developers. Feel free to explore, and if 
       you don’t find your answer here, feel free to reach out via the contact page.
    </p>
    <dl id="faq">
        <dt class="hiddenAnswer">What programming languages are you most comfortable with?</dt>
        <dd>
            <p>I am most comfortable with C++ and Java. I also have experience with C#, Python, 
            JavaScript and Swift, but the majority of my projects use C++. I have fallen a little in love with making iOS apps this semester, so I expect I will be spending more time with Swift in the coming year.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt class="hiddenAnswer">Have you always wanted to be a software developer?</dt>
        <dd>
            <p>I have always been interested in tech, and was an early adopter in the 2000's (I was a Twitter beta tester, actually!), but I chose to go to culinary school 
                out of high school and worked for many years as a professional pastry chef. It was a rewarding career, but hard on me physically, and I like many others decided to make a change during COVID. I was fortunate to land a job in the IT Department of a local company, where I've been working full-time for the last two years while going to school. My hope is to be hired as a programmer once I complete my BS in Computer Science in a couple years.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt class="hiddenAnswer">How do you manage version control?</dt>
        <dd>
            <p>I rely on Git for version control and host most of my repositories on GitHub. This allows 
            easy collaboration, issue tracking, and code reviews to maintain a high quality standard. I find the GitHub Large File Storage to be particularly useful when collaborating on code that uses large libraries, like wxWidgets in my Chore App. </p>
        </dd>

        <dt class="hiddenAnswer">Do you offer open-source contributions?</dt>
        <dd>
            <p>Yes! I’m always looking to contribute to open-source projects and encourage others to 
            join mine. Contributing to open-source fosters community learning, improves code quality, 
            and provides valuable feedback from other developers.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt class="hiddenAnswer">Can I suggest new features for your projects?</dt>
        <dd>
            <p>Absolutely. Feel free to reach out using the contact form or by opening an issue on the 
            project’s GitHub repository. I welcome new ideas and constructive feedback.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt class="hiddenAnswer">What is your development environment setup?</dt>
        <dd>
            <p>I currently primarily work in Visual Studio Code with a customized set of extensions for 
            linting, formatting, and debugging. I exclusively used Visual Studio the first year I was coding, and I still think it's the best for large-scale projects, but I've become attached to VS Code's lighter and more customizable extensions. I use eclipse for Java programming, and Xcode when writing apps for iOS and macOS.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt class="hiddenAnswer">How do you approach testing?</dt>
        <dd>
            <p>I use automated testing frameworks like Jest (for JavaScript), 
            and JUnit (for Java). Testing helps catch bugs early and ensures the reliability and 
            maintainability of the codebase. As the great Professor Koss says, "Testing is free! Test early, and test often."</p>
        </dd>

        <dt class="hiddenAnswer">Do you have any recommendations for beginner developers?</dt>
        <dd>
            <p>Don't rely on ChatGPT too much! You may be able to complete a project, but you won't understand it if you just copy and paste from AI. Start small and build projects that interest you. Focus on learning fundamental concepts 
            like data structures, algorithms, and clean coding practices. Don’t be afraid to ask 
            questions, look for mentorship, and join coding communities.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt class="hiddenAnswer">How do you handle project documentation?</dt>
        <dd>
            <p>I maintain README files for each project in the GitHub repositories, along with dedicated Wiki pages on GitHub 
            when needed. I also write inline comments and use tools like JSDoc for automatic 
            documentation generation. I find ChatGPT very useful for helping with documentation, which can sometimes be tedious and less fun than coding.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt class="hiddenAnswer">Can I fork and use your code for my own projects?</dt>
        <dd>
            <p>In most cases, yes. My repositories typically include an open-source license 
            (e.g., MIT) allowing you to fork, modify, and use the code. Please review the 
            license to ensure compliance and give appropriate credit. If you're not sure, reach out and we'll chat!</p>
